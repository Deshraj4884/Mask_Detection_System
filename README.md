# Mask_Detection_System<br>## WHAT<br>It is a computer Vision Application which can first detect the faces into an imageand then whether the face has a mask or not and save the face of no mask.  The Application can get the image from different source such as image, video, webcam , IP camera.  This application will be used using browser on a local Area Network.<br>##  WHY<br>This System can be used in many places such as hospitals, Research Labs, Nuclear Power Plants, Air Born Disease, High AQI Areas.<br>## HOW<br>Backend : Code, Functionalities<br>Face Detection : Open CV<br>Mask Detection : Tensorflow<br><br>Frontend : interface<br>Web Application : Streamlit<br><br>1.
