# Mask_Detection_System<br># WHAT1. It is a computer Vision Application which can first detect the faces into an imageand then whether the face has a mask or not and save the face of no mask. 2. The Application can get the image from different source such as image, video, webcam , IP camera. 3. This application will be used using browser on a local Area Network. WHY1. This System can be used in many places such as hospitals, Research Labs, Nuclear Power Plants, Air Born Disease, High AQI Areas. HOW1.
